# prime-settings
PRIME Settings is an application developed with web technologies to help Linux users choose which applications can run with their notebook's dGPU with hybrid graphics.

To run, the application uses MAGMA, a solution based on NW.js (https://nwjs.io/), but it is possible to use other frameworks such as Electron.
