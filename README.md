# PRIME Settings

PRIME Settings is an application developed with web technologies to help Linux users choose which applications can run with their notebook's dGPU with hybrid graphics equipped with AMD or NVIDIA GPU. To run, the application uses MAGMA, a solution based on [NW.js] (https://nwjs.io/), but it is possible to use other frameworks such as Electron.

## For NVIDIA's dGPU laptops, you must have the NVIDIA Driver 435.21 or later driver installed.
